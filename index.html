            <p> I took the year after my first year of college off. I just wasn't that into anything academic. Don't get me wrong, <br>I loved all the fun and games, but was not really ready for <em>the future</em>. So after taking my first year at UCLA I took a leave of absence. <br> Went home, worked for a bit, saved up some money, then spent 7 months travelling Central America </p>
