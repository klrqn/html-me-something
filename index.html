            <p> I took the year after my first year of college off. I just wasn't that into anything academic. Don't get me wrong, I loved all the fun and games, but was not really ready for <em>the future</em>. So after taking my first year at UCLA I took a leave of absence. Went home, worked for a bit, saved up some money, then spent 7 months travelling Central America </p>
        <p>I took off!</p>

            <figcaption>This is me standing in a mangrove area next to a sign that says "Peligroso Cocodrillos", or "Danger Crocodiles" Costa Rica is quite Tropical!</figcaption>

            <figcaption>I travelled a bit on the East Coast of Costa Rica, which is so different from the West Coast.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>One of my favorite overlooks just South of the small town I lived in for the majority of my time in Costa Rica. You had to scramble up a 50' wall and then walk through the jungle a bit but then there would be a grassy knoll overlooking the Ocean. Just Beautiful.</figcaption>
            <img src="images/lookin.jpg" alt="funny stuff"/>
            <figcaption> Funny Scenes like this abound. There were wild horses that would run on the beaches and it was just so beautiful to watch.</figcaption>
