            <p> I took the year after my first year of college off. I just wasn't that into anything academic. Don't get me wrong, I loved all the fun and games, but was not really ready for <em>the future</em>. So after taking off half way through my third quarter at UCLA, I dropped out. Went home, and started working at the lake as a lifeguard, something I'd been doing since I was 15.

            The job ended in the Fall, and I was up $8k and down nothing to do...so I took off!
